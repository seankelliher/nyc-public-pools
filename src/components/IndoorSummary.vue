        <h3>Indoor Pools</h3>
        <p>
            Indoor public pools are <strong>open year-round</strong> and located
            within recreation centers. To use these pools, you purchase a
            membership to the recreation center. An annual membership costs $150
            for adults and $25 for seniors (ages 62 and older), and is free for
            anyone under the age of 18. Schedules at indoor pools vary. See each
            pool for details.
